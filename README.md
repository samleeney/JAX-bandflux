JAX-bandflux presents an implementation of supernova light curve modelling using JAX. The codebase offers a differentiable approach to core [SNCosmo](https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) functionality implemented in JAX.

## Installation

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install jax-bandflux
```

### Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/samleeney/JAX-bandflux.git
```

### For development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samleeney/JAX-bandflux.git
cd JAX-bandflux
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

JAX-bandflux requires:

- Python >= 3.10
- JAX >= 0.4.20 (with CUDA support for GPU acceleration)
- NumPy >= 1.24.0
- SNCosmo >= 2.9.0
- BlackJAX (for nested sampling: requires Handley Lab fork, not yet merged with main branch)
- Distrax (for probability distributions)

> **Note:** For nested sampling examples, you must install the Handley Lab fork of BlackJAX (not yet merged with main branch):
> ```bash
> pip install git+https://github.com/handley-lab/blackjax@proposal
> ```
> See: https://handley-lab.co.uk/nested-sampling-book/intro.html

## Quickstart

Run example analogous to [SNCosmo](https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)'s "Using a custom fitter" example:

```bash
pip install jax-bandflux
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samleeney/JAX-bandflux/master/examples/fmin_bfgs.py
python fmin_bfgs.py
```

## API Compatibility with SNCosmo

JAX-bandflux provides an API similar to SNCosmo's SALT3Source, with key differences for JAX compatibility:

### Functional Parameter API

Parameters are passed as dictionaries to methods rather than stored as object attributes. This is a **hard constraint** for JIT compilation - JAX requires pure functional code where all inputs are explicit arguments.

**SNCosmo approach:**
```python
source.set(z=0.5, t0=0, x0=1e-5, x1=0.5, c=0.1)
flux = source.bandflux('bessellb', time=10)
```

**JAX-bandflux approach:**
```python
from jax_supernovae import SALT3Source

source = SALT3Source()
params = {'x0': 1e-5, 'x1': 0.5, 'c': 0.1}
flux = source.bandflux(params, 'bessellb', phase=10/(1+0.5))
```

This enables JIT compilation while maintaining numerical accuracy within **0.001%** of SNCosmo.

### Performance Optimization with Bridges

The `bridges` parameter allows precomputed filter integration grids, providing **~100x speedup** for repeated calculations (e.g., nested sampling):

```python
from jax_supernovae.salt3 import precompute_bandflux_bridge

# Precompute once
bridges = [precompute_bandflux_bridge(bp) for bp in bandpasses]

# Reuse thousands of times in JIT-compiled functions
@jax.jit
def likelihood(params):
    flux = source.bandflux(params, None, phases,
                          bridges=bridges,
                          band_indices=indices,
                          unique_bands=bands)
    return -0.5 * chi2
```

**What are bridges?** Precomputed wavelength grids with interpolated filter transmission values. Instead of interpolating the filter for every likelihood evaluation, you compute it once and reuse it. For nested sampling with 10,000+ evaluations, this provides a massive speedup.

See the [documentation](https://jax-bandflux.readthedocs.io/) for details.

## Testing

This repository implements the JAX version of the [SNCosmo](https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) bandflux function. Although the implementations are nearly identical, a minor difference exists due to the absence of a specific interpolation function in JAX, resulting in a discrepancy of approximately 0.001% in bandflux results. Tests have been provided to confirm that key functions in the [SNCosmo](https://sncosmo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) version correspond with our JAX implementation. It is recommended to run these tests, especially following any modifications.

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## What is the `.airules` file?

The `.airules` file provides essential context to help language models understand and work with this codebaseâ€”particularly for new code that may not be included in model training datasets. It contains detailed information on:

- Data structures
- Core functions
- Implementation constraints
- Testing requirements

If you are using Cursor, rename this file to `.cursorrules` to enable automatic context integration.
